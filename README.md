During this project some key algortihms were implemented from scratch e.g:
  - [**RANSAC**](https://github.com/adamanov/SFND_Lidar_Obstacle_Detection/blob/master/src/quiz/ransac/ransac2d.cpp)
  - [**K-d Tree**](https://github.com/adamanov/SFND_Lidar_Obstacle_Detection/blob/master/src/quiz/cluster/kdtree.h)
  - [**Eucledean Clustering**](https://github.com/adamanov/SFND_Lidar_Obstacle_Detection/blob/master/src/quiz/cluster/cluster.cpp) 
 
 
 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### 1. Compiling and Testing
- The submission must compile.
```c++
```

#### 2. Obstacle Detection
- Filtering the point cloud
```c++
```
- Bounding boxes enclose appropriate objects.
```c++
```
- Objects are consistently detected across frames in the video.
```c++
```
- Segmentation is implemented in the project.
```c++
```
- Clustering is implemented in the project.
```c++
```


 #### 3. Code Efficiency
- The methods in the code should avoid unnecessary calculations.
```c++
```
